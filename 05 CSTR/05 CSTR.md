## Simulation of a Flash Column

## Objective

Develop a simple process sheet to determine the exit composition from a Continous stirred tank reactor (CSTR)  

## Data

Reaction: Ethylene glycol production in CSTR: Ethylene oxide reacts with water to form Ethylene Glycol 

Inlet stream:  26 m3/h of aqueous solution of Ethylene oxide with a mol fraction of 15% and rest water. Reaction carried out at 55 °C under atmospheric condition in CSTR of 2 m3

$$C_2\ H_4\ O_((l))\ \ +\ H_2\ O_((l))\ \ \rightarrow C_2\ H_6\ O_(2(l))$$

Reaction rate is defined as 

$$-r\ =\ kC_E0$$

Where CEO: Molarity of Ethylene oxide; k: rate constant = 0.005 l/s
