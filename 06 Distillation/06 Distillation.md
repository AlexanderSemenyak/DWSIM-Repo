## Simulation of a Distillation Column

## Objective

Develop a simple process flow sheet to estimate distillate and bottom composition of a distillation column  

## Data

100 kmol/h of an equimolar mixture of benzene and toluene at 70Â°C and 1 atm pressure is to be separated by staged distillation column. A reflux ratio of 3 is used.  Composition of benzene in the distillate should be 99% (by mol) toluene in the bottom should be 99% (mol). A total condenser and reboiler, both at 1 atm pressure are used. Determine the actual no. of stages, minimum reflux ratio and the minimum no. of stages for the operation.
