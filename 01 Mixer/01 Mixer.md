## Mixing of Ideal Liquid Streams

## Objective

Develop a simple process sheet to mix two liquid streams and estimate the flow rate and composition of outlet stream. 

## Data

Inlet stream 1:  10 mol % Methanol solution flowing at 20 kmol/h 

Inlet stream 2: 80 mol % Methanol solution flowing at 10 kmol/h

Both the streams are at 30°C and at 1 bar pressure

The liquid streams can be considered as ideal
